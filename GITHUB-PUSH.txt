Push this project to https://github.com/novarides/Nova-Rides

Run in PowerShell (from any folder):

  & "C:\Users\dieko\NOVA RIDES 2\push-to-github.ps1"

Or open a terminal in the project folder, then:

  .\push-to-github.ps1

If you get an execution policy error, run first:
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

The script will: init git (if needed), set remote to Nova-Rides.git, add all files, commit, and push to main.
You may be prompted to sign in to GitHub.
