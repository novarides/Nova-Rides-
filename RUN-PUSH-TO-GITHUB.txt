Push Nova Rides to GitHub
========================

The script was not found because the terminal is in a different folder.
Use ONE of these (copy and paste into PowerShell):

Option A - Full path to project (one space in "NOVA RIDES 2"):
  & "C:\Users\dieko\NOVA RIDES 2\push-to-github.ps1"

Option B - If your project is under .cursor:
  & "$env:USERPROFILE\.cursor\projects\c-Users-dieko-NOVA-RIDES-2\push-to-github.ps1"

Option C - Go to the folder that contains push-to-github.ps1, then run:
  Get-ChildItem -Filter push-to-github.ps1 -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty DirectoryName
  (then:  cd "that-path"  and  .\push-to-github.ps1)

If you get "execution policy" error, run first:
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
